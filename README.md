Implementing email in onboarding flow, that's it.

For future:
- Improve document download email template
- Implementing tags and categories for products
- Better user interface and user experience based on feedback testing
- Better analytics and logs in seller dashboard (maybe logs for each purchase and who bought it)
- Be able to change quantity of products and buy more than one product at a time
